This is the code test for deeplocal written by Josh Hnat. It uses python and the tweepy library to count the most 
popular hashtags used by the official deep local twitter account in the year 2017. It is a regular console application 
that is simply called by using the following command in the same directory that twit.py is found in

`python twit.py`

There should not be any compatibility issues with this console application between the different python versions. So 
installing either 3.x or 2.7 should be fine.

The API secrets and keys are going to be sent to you via email. Please copy and paste code I send via email into the 
area marked 
`PLACE API KEYS HERE`

Values for the date and account are hardcoded as there weren't any stipulations about checking other accounts or 
changing the period to check for.

This program requires the following to be installed on your system.

tweepy: `pip install tweepy`

All other libraries should be included in your default install of python. If they are not, the only other libraries used
are the following. 

Counter: `pip install Counter`

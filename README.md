This is the code test for deeplocal written by Josh Hnat. It uses python and the tweepy library to count the most 
popular hashtags used by the official deep local twitter account in the year 2017. It is a regular console application 
that is simply called by using

`python twit.py`

Values for the date and account are hardcoded as there weren't any stipulations about checking other accounts or 
changing the period to check for.

This program requires the following to be installed on your system.

tweepy: `pip install tweepy`
